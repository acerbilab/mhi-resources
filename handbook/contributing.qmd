# Contributing Guide

Here are the detailed steps to ensure a smooth workflow. **It's simply editting the `.qmd` file and making pull requests on GitHub**. So don't be scared ðŸ˜‰.

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Visit the [handbook repository](https://github.com/acerbilab/handbook) and click on "Fork" to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/handbook.git
   cd handbook
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**  
   Before making changes, create a new branch to keep your work organized:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. **Add or Modify Content**  
   - Write or edit a `(q)markdown` file as needed.
   - If you're adding a new chapter, create a new `.qmd` file, then include it under the `book: chapters:` field in [_quarto.yml](https://github.com/acerbilab/handbook/blob/main/_quarto.yml). For example:
    ```yaml
     book:
       chapters:
         - index.qmd
         - part: Python tools
           - your-new-chapter.qmd
     ```

5. **Preview Locally**
   
   To see your changes before pushing, build and preview the book locally. You could use for example VSCode as the editor and Quarto has a VSCode plugin to help preview the book website locally, see instructions [here](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html).
   
   Or make sure you have Quarto installed, then run in bash terminal:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```
   This will open a live preview in your browser where you can verify your changes.

6. **Commit and Push Changes**  
   After making sure your changes look good, commit and push them to your fork:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Make a Pull Request**  
   Go to the original [handbook repository](https://github.com/acerbilab/handbook) and open a Pull Request from your branch. Provide a brief summary of your changes and mention any specific details reviewers should be aware of.
