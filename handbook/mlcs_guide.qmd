## Seminar Day Checklist

### Equipment Setup

1. **Get Equipment**:
   - Pick up the **Blackstorm Scout microphone** (USB) from IT support (the microphone is stored in room A216, has black and purple box).
   - Retrieve the **Owl camera** from meeting room A318 (stored in a white box on the side table by the door).

2. **Classroom Setup**:
   Setting up the classroom for the hybrid seminar (in-person and Zoom attendees) can be tricky so ensure to test in advance for the first time. There are two main setups to consider:

    - **Using your own laptop without the classroom computer**:
      - Connect the microphone and Owl camera to your laptop. You could test in advance to ensure they work with your laptop.
      - Position the Owl camera on the table in front of the podium.
      - Start the Zoom meeting from your laptop
      - Let the speaker join the Zoom meeting from their laptop, muting the speaker's laptop microphone and turning off the camera. The speaker should use the microphone connected to your laptop.
      - Connect the speaker's laptop to the projector and share their screen. 
      - If the projector doesn't work with the speaker's laptop, you can connect your laptop for sharing the speaker's screen, which is less ideal since it will have some Zoom toolbar visible on the screen.
      - **Start recording** in Zoom.
   - **Using the classsroom computer**:
     - Connect the microphone and Owl camera to the classroom computer. Some classroom computers might not work well, so you might need to use your laptop instead. See the previous setup for details.
     - Start the projector.
     - Start the Zoom meeting from your laptop.
     - Let the speaker join the Zoom meeting from their laptop.
     - Log into Zoom from the classroom computer (you'll need the university account for login) and share the meeting to the projector screen.
     - **Start recording** in Zoom


### Zoom Meeting Management

1. Record the session on your laptop.
2. Monitor Zoom chat and read questions aloud if needed.
3. Note the number of Zoom attendees.

### Attendance Tracking

- Circulate the attendance list and a pen once the talk begins.
- Make a note of the Zoom attendance count.

4. **Edit and Upload Video**:
   - Use QuickTime or a similar tool for video editing.
   - Upload the edited video to YouTube.
