# Task: Create a Landing Page for the Normalizing Flow Regression Paper

Create a comprehensive, visually appealing landing page for the machine learning paper "Normalizing Flow Regression for Bayesian Inference with Offline Likelihood Evaluations" using the provided template files. The landing page should effectively communicate the paper's key contributions while maintaining a professional, accessible design.

# Analysis

The paper "Normalizing Flow Regression for Bayesian Inference with Offline Likelihood Evaluations" introduces a novel approach to Bayesian inference using normalizing flows as regression models for approximating posterior distributions from existing log-density evaluations. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where traditional inference methods are impractical due to computationally expensive likelihood evaluations.

After reviewing the paper and provided template files:

1. The paper has a clear structure with introduction, methodology, experiments, and results.
2. It contains several key visualizations and equations that need to be properly formatted.
3. The existing template includes all necessary structural elements: header, TL;DR, citation, interactive features, etc.
4. The template's design is responsive and includes accessibility features to be preserved.

The landing page needs to balance technical detail with accessibility, providing both a high-level overview for newcomers and sufficient technical details for experts in the field.

# Implementation Strategy

I'll adapt the template files to showcase this specific paper while maintaining the established design and functionality. The HTML file will require the most significant changes to incorporate the paper's content, while CSS and JS modifications will be minimal and focused on supporting any new content needs.

# Implementation Plan

## Commit 1: Create Basic Structure and Header Content

- Description: Establish the basic structure of the landing page by adapting the header section, adding paper-specific metadata, and setting up the citation information.
