# Machine Learning Paper Submission Checklist

Go through the list **well in advance** before submission to ensure all the necessary information is available.

## I. Author-Related Information

- [ ] **Finalize Author List & Order:**
  - [ ] Confirm all individuals meeting authorship criteria are included.
  - [ ] Agree on the order of authors with all co-authors.
  - [ ] Designate a corresponding author if one is required (typically the first or last author).
- [ ] **Prepare Acknowledgments:** Draft acknowledgments section (individual funding, computing resources, etc.); can be posptoned for anonymized submissions until the camera-ready version.
- [ ] **Prepare Conflict of Interest (COI) Disclosure:** Identify and be ready to list any COIs for all authors as per venue policy (this is often done by individual authors, e.g., on OpenReview).
- [ ] **Check for Reciprocal Reviewing Requirements:** See if any author needs to register as a reviewer for the venue.
- [ ] **Create Account(s) on Submission Portal:** Ensure all submitting authors have active accounts well in advance.
- [ ] **Confirm All Co-Authors Approve the Final Version for Submission:** This is an essential ethical step.

## II. Venue-Specific Requirements & Policies

- [ ] **Confirm Submission Deadlines:** Note abstract registration, full paper submission, and any other relevant deadlines (time zone crucial!). (See Section IV for Supplementary Material deadline).
- [ ] **Thoroughly Review Venue Author Guidelines:** Access and read the specific "Author Kit," "Submission Guidelines," or "Information for Authors" for the target conference/journal.
- [ ] **Check Prior Publication/Dual Submission Policy:** Ensure your work complies (e.g., not currently under review elsewhere, content is substantially new).
- [ ] **Note Policy on Use of Generative AI (LLMs):** Ensure compliance with venue guidelines regarding disclosure and author responsibility.
- [ ] **Locate and Prepare Venue-Specific Submission Forms/Checklists:** Download and review any mandatory forms (e.g., NeurIPS checklist, reproducibility checklist).

## III. Manuscript Formatting & File Preparation (Main Paper)

- [ ] **Adhere to Anonymization Rules for Main Manuscript (for Double-Blind):**
  - [ ] Remove author names and affiliations from the manuscript PDF.
  - [ ] Remove identifying information from PDF metadata.
  - [ ] Check for and anonymize self-citations written in the first person (e.g., "In our previous work [X]..." should be "Author et al. [X] demonstrated...").
  - [ ] Ensure no links to personal/institutional websites or identifiable code repositories are in the main paper if they reveal identity.
- [ ] **Use Correct Venue LaTeX Style/Word Template:** Ensure the latest official template is used.
- [ ] **Verify Page Limits:** Confirm adherence to limits for the main paper (and any limits on references or appendices if specified for the main document).
- [ ] **Check Font Usage & Embedding:**
  - [ ] Ensure all fonts are embedded in the PDF.
  - [ ] Verify no Type-3 fonts are used if disallowed (common LaTeX issue).
- [ ] **Confirm Paper Size & Margins:** (e.g., US Letter or A4, as specified).
- [ ] **Finalize Title & Abstract:** Ensure they are concise, accurately reflect content, and meet any length restrictions.
- [ ] **Verify Keywords/Index Terms:** Check they are included and appropriate.
- [ ] **Ensure Consistent Reference Formatting:** Use the venue's specified citation style if needed; check for capitalization, missing venues, etc.
- [ ] **Plan Appendix References in Main Paper:** If appendix is separate/WIP, decide on a consistent referencing strategy (e.g., "see Appendix," "see Appendix Section X," or by topic).
- [ ] **Check Figure/Table Placement & Captions:** Ensure they are legible, correctly numbered, and captioned as per guidelines.
- [ ] **Prepare Final PDF of Main Manuscript:** Generate the high-quality PDF for submission.
- [ ] **File Naming Conventions:** Follow any specified naming rules for your main manuscript file.

## IV. Supplementary Material

- [ ] **Confirm Supplementary Material Submission Deadline:** Note if it's different from the main paper deadline (time zone crucial!).
- [ ] **Anonymize Supplementary Material if Required by the Venue.**
- [ ] **Prepare Code/Data for Submission (if applicable/required):**
  - [ ] Package code cleanly.
  - [ ] Include a README with setup instructions, dependencies, and steps to run experiments.
  - [ ] Anonymize code if submitted during a double-blind review and if it contains identifiable information.
  - [ ] Confirm accessibility if linking to (anonymous) external repositories (and that links are anonymized if needed).
- [ ] **Compile Appendices/Supplementary Document:**
  - [ ] Include detailed proofs, extra results, algorithm pseudocode, or dataset details not fitting in the main paper.
  - [ ] Ensure it adheres to any page limits or formatting rules for supplementary material.
- [ ] **File Naming Conventions:** Follow any specified naming rules for supplementary material files.

## V. Reproducibility

- [ ] **Check Computational Resources Disclosure:** Ensure information about compute resources (hardware, software versions, runtimes) is included in the paper or supplement as required.
- [ ] **Complete Venue-Specific Reproducibility Checklist:** Fill out any required reproducibility forms accurately.

## VI. Ethical Considerations & Disclosures

- [ ] **Prepare Broader Impact/Societal Consequences Statement:** Write or refine this section if required or encouraged by the venue.
- [ ] **Review Ethical Guidelines:** Ensure the research and paper adhere to the venue's ethical conduct codes (e.g., NeurIPS Code of Ethics).
- [ ] **Check Data Privacy & Consent Statements:** If using human subject data, ensure all necessary statements regarding ethical collection, consent, and privacy are included.
- [ ] **Acknowledge Asset Licenses:** Verify proper credit and mention of licenses for any used code, data, or models.

## VII. Online Submission System

- [ ] **Enter Paper Title, Abstract, Keywords in System:** Copy-paste or type accurately.
- [ ] **Add All Co-Authors Correctly in the System:** Ensure names, affiliations, and email addresses are accurate as per the agreed author list and order. Confirm corresponding author designation in the system.
- [ ] **Upload Main Manuscript PDF:** Double-check it's the final, correct, and (if applicable) anonymized version.
- [ ] **Upload Supplementary Material (Code, Data, Appendix PDF):** Ensure all files are correctly attached in the designated sections and are anonymized if required.
- [ ] **Fill Out All Required Submission Forms/Questionnaires in the Portal:** This may include COI, author contributions, reproducibility details, ethics statements, etc.
- [ ] **Review Submission Proof/Preview:** Carefully check the system-generated proof for any conversion, formatting errors, or metadata issues before final submission.

## VIII. Final Critical Checks (Before Hitting "Submit")

- [ ] **One Last Read-Through of the PDF:** Focus on clarity, typos, and glaring errors.
- [ ] **Verify Claims in Abstract & Introduction:** Ensure they accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope especially if there were last-minute changes.
- [ ] **Confirm Discussion of Limitations is Present.**
